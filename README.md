# MyDataStructures.

This repository contains various generic data structures which I have created while learning C.
This repository may soon be renamed to something else as a I implement some algorithms. I 
intend to implement Dijkstra, quick sort, and A* soon, and then I will be uploading some. 
Concurrent programs where I intend to use some of the algorithms and data structures together.

while these data structures are functional, fairly efficient and do not contain any memory leaks.
they have been implemented by an intermediate C programmer, so use at own risk.
