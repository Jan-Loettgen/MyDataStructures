# MyDataStructures.

This repsitory contains various generic datastructures which I have created while learning C.
This repository may soon be renamed to something else as a I implement some algorithms. I 
intend to implement Djikstra, quick sort, and A* soon, and then I will be uploading some 
Concurrent programs where I intend to use some of the algorithms and datastrucutres together.

Whilest these data strucutres are functional, fairly efficient and do not contain any memory leaks
they have been implemented by an intermidiate C programmer, so use at own risk.
